          <figcaption>Indiana Jones is one of the most iconic characters in movie history. 
            Indy first hit the screen in 1981 and he delivered the final chapter of his story
            this summer. After seeing the final film in the theater and re-watching the others, 
            here are my personal rankings of one of my favorite franchises.</figcaption>

              <p class="review">It’s got some of the Indiana Jones magic but it’s 
                not quite the same. It just feels less inspired. Not as bad as the 
                South Park episode leads on.</p>

              <img src="images/last-crusade.jpeg" alt="The Last Crusade movie poster">
              <p class="review">This one falls off a little bit for me on re-watch. 
                The final act is iconic, and I love Sean Connery, but it all gets a 
                little too hokey for me.</p>

          <section class="number-3">
            <h3>#3 <i>The Dial of Destiny</i> (2023)</h3> 
            <div class="container">
              <img src="images/dial-of-destiny.jpeg" alt="The Dial of Destiny movie poster">
              <p class="review">Way exceeded my expectations. I don’t get how you can’t love 
                this movie. The voice/body sync was weird, but the prologue is incredible, 
                almost Casino Royale level. The action is fantastic throughout and they use 
                the nostalgia tastefully. I enjoy the way Indy’s goddaughter resembles him but 
                also presents her own unique and complementary persona. There are some plot holes 
                and question marks, and it’s too long. But hey it’s a send off movie and it was a 
                fitting way to honor an iconic American character.</p>

              <img src="images/temple-of-doom.jpeg" alt="The Temple of Doom movie poster">
              <p class="review">This was the movie in the original trilogy that seared into 
                my young mind the most. It’s a perfect concoction of evil, presented on a platter 
                for the audience to shudder at. As a 10 year old, I was roped in, and as a 30 year 
                old I still shudder.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <img src="images/raiders.jpeg" alt="Raiders of the Lost Ark movie poster">
              <p class="review">Rewatching these for the first time in a while, and for the 
                first time ever with our kids - the legend and action of Indiana Jones is top level. 
                Spielberg found a great formula (minus the misogyny), and he built on it well, just 
                as he did with Jurassic Park.  I don’t connect with Raiders of the Lost Ark enough 
                to say it’s one of my favorite films. I’m interested in thinking through what 
                Spielberg has to say about the spectrum of faith v fantasy he presents. He seems to 
                be exploring his religious roots in all of these films. But I’m not sure there’s a 
                lot of substance to what he has to say. But I know I’ll be revisiting this story for 
                years to come.</p>
